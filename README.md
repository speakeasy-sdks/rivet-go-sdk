## SDK Available Operations


### MatchmakerLobbies

* `LobbiesServiceFind` - Finds a lobby based on the given criteria.
If a lobby is not found and `prevent_auto_create_lobby` is `true`, 
a new lobby will be created.

* `LobbiesServiceJoin` - Joins a specific lobby.
This request will use the direct player count configured for the
lobby group.

* `LobbiesServiceList` - Lists all open lobbies.
* `LobbiesServiceSetClosed` - If `is_closed` is `true`, players will be prevented from joining the lobby.
Does not shutdown the lobby.


### MatchmakerRegions

* `RegionsServiceList` - Returns a list of regions available to this namespace.

Regions are sorted by most optimal to least optimal. The player's IP address
is used to calculate the regions' optimality.
